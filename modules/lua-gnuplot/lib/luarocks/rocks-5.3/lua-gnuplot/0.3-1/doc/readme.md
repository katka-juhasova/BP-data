# lua-gnuplot

## About

lua-gnuplot is a small library for using gnuplot in a Lua program. It works by
generating a [gnuplot][1] script from a Lua plot definition and calling the
gnuplot program for you.

lua-gnuplot is licensed under the MIT license and can be freely used for
academic and commercial purposes.

## Dependencies

lua-gnuplot depends on gnuplot binaries.

## Install

lua-gnuplot is a pure Lua library. To install it, copy gnuplot.lua to into your
Lua shared folder (eg, /usr/share/lua/5.2). You can also use the published
Lua rock.

## Documentation

There is no documentation. Read the (rather compact) source code or see
example.lua.
